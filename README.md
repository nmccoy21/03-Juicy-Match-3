# 03-Juicy-Match-3
Completes (attempts) Project 03 for C220.
Due 3/2/2022

## Implementation
I implemented numerous features to the best of my ability, but needless to say I'm not too proud of this one.

I added custom colors for the tiles, two animated shader backgrounds, "music" and sound affects to the game.
I also added a level counter, but reveiwing the submission page the line for containing at least two levels was crossed out, so I didnt pursue it any further.
